    <h2>Heuristic evaluation</h2>
<h3>Heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method for computer software that helps to identify usability problems in the user interface (UI) design. It specifically involves evaluators examining the interface and judging its compliance with recognized usability principles (the &ldquo;heuristics&rdquo;). These evaluation methods are now widely taught and practiced in the new media sector, where UIs are often designed in a short space of time on a budget that may restrict the amount of money available to provide for other types of interface testing.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Usability Guidelines (&ldquo;Heuristics&rdquo;)</h3>
<p>Different set of guidlines are provided by experts to evaluate the usability of a UI. Depending on the type of the system and desired output, a standard set of attributes can be evalutated. Alternatively, a new set of values can be defined if neccessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nielsen&rsquo;s 10 principles</li>
<li>Norman&rsquo;s rules from Design of Everyday Things</li>
<li>Tognazzini&rsquo;s 16 principles</li>
<li>Shneiderman&rsquo;s 8 golden rules</li>
<li>Gerhardt-Powals' cognitive engineering principles</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h3>Nielsen&rsquo;s 10 principles :</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Visibility of system status:</h3>
The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</li>
<li>
<h3>Match between system and the real world:</h3>
The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</li>
<li>
<h3>User control and freedom:</h3>
Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.</li>
<li>
<h3>Consistency and standards:</h3>
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.</li>
<li>
<h3>Error prevention:</h3>
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.</li>
<li>
<h3>Recognition rather than recall:</h3>
Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.</li>
<li>
<h3>Flexibility and efficiency of use:</h3>
Accelerators&mdash;unseen by the novice user&mdash;may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</li>
<li>
<h3>Aesthetic and minimalist design:</h3>
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.</li>
<li>
<h3>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:</h3>
Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.</li>
<li>
<h3>Help and documentation:</h3>
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h3>Tog’s First Principles :</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Anticipation:</h3>
Try to anticipate the user’s wants and needs.
<br>Give user all information and tools needed for each step..</li>
<li>
<h3>Autonomy :</h3>
The computer, the interface, and the task environment all "belong" to the user.
<br>Give user control by keeping her informed.</li>
<li>
<h3>Color Blindness:</h3>
When using color use clear, secondary cues.</li>
<li>
<h3>Consistency:</h3>
 The most important consistency is consistency with user expectations.
<br>The importance of strict consistency varies.
<br>It is just important to be visually inconsistent when things must act differently
as it is to be visually consistent when things act the same.</li>
<li>
<h3>Defaults :</h3>
 Defaults should be easy to “blow away.”
<br>They should be “intelligent” and responsive.</li>
<li>
<h3>Efficiency of the User:</h3>
 Consider user’s productivity, not the computer’s.
<br>Keep the user occupied.
<br>Maximize everyone’s efficiency.</li>

<li>
<h3>Explorable Interfaces:</h3>
Give user roads and landmarks, but allow exploration.
<br>Give user stable cues for a sense of “home.”
<br>Allow undo
<br>Allow a way out.</li>
<li>
<h3>Fitts's Law :</h3>
The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target..</li>
<li>
<h3>Human Interface Objects:</h3>
 User’s interface objects appear within the user's environment.
<br>They can be seen, heard, touched, etc.
<br>They have a standard way of interacting with standard resulting behaviors.
<br>They should be understandable, self-consistent and stable.</li>
<li>
<h3>Latency Reduction:</h3>
 Reduce the user’s experience of latency.
<br>Push latency into the background.</li>
<li>
<h3>Learnability :</h3>
All applications and services have a learning curve.
<br>Limit trade-offs between usability and learnability.</li>
<li>
<h3>Use of Metaphors:</h3>
 Choose metaphors well to enable the user to grasp the conceptual model.
<br>Bring metaphors alive by appeal to kinesthesia.</li>
<li>  <h3>Protect Users' Work:</h3>
Ensure that users never lose work, unless completely unavoidable.</li>
<li>
<h3>Readability :</h3>
Text that must be read should have high contrast.
<br>Use font sizes large enough.
<br>Don’t forget those with special needs.</li>
<li>
<h3>Track State:</h3>
Keep track of state.
<br>Store it for later use.</li>
    <li>
<h3>Visible Navigation:</h3>
 Avoid invisible navigation.
<br>Do not prevail upon user to build elaborate mental maps.</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules :</h3>
    <ul>
<li>
<h3>    Strive for Consistency :</h3>
Designing “consistent interfaces” means using the same design patterns and the same sequences of actions for similar situations. This includes, but isn’t limited to, the right use of color, typography and terminology in prompt screens, commands, and menus throughout your user journey.  </li>
<li>
<h3>Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts   :</h3>
Speaking of using UI rules as shortcuts, your users will benefit from shortcuts as well, especially if they need to complete the same tasks often. Expert users might find the following features helpful:
<br>Abbreviations 
<br>Function keys 
<br>Hidden commands 
<br>Macro facilities </li>
<li>
<h3>Offer Informative Feedback :</h3>
You need to keep your users informed of what is happening at every stage of their process. This feedback needs to be meaningful, relevant, clear, and fit the context. </li>
<li>
<h3> Offer Simple Error Handling :</h3>
A good interface should be designed to avoid errors as much as possible. But when errors do happen, your system needs to make it easy for the user to understand the issue and know how to solve it. Simple ways to handle errors include displaying clear error notifications along with descriptive hints to solve the problem.  </li>
<li>
<h3>Permit Easy Reversal of Actions  :</h3>
 It’s an instant relief to find that “undo” option after a mistake is made. Your users will feel less anxious and more likely to explore options if they know there’s an easy way to reverse any accidents.  

This rule can be applied to any action, group of actions, or data entry. It can range from a simple button to a whole history of actions.  
<li>
<h3>Support Internal Locus of Control :</h3>
It’s important to give control and freedom to your users so they’re able to feel they’re in charge of the system, not the other way round. Avoid surprises, interruptions, or anything that hasn’t be prompted by the users.  

<br>Users should be the initiators of the actions rather than the responders. </li>

    <h3>Reduce Short-Term Memory Load :</h3>
Our attention span is limited and anything we can do to make our users’ job easier, the better. It’s simpler for us to recognize information rather than recall it. Here, we can refer to one of Nielsen’s principles describing “recognition over recall”. If we keep our interfaces simple and consistent, obeying to patterns, standards and conventions, we are already contributing to better recognition and ease of use.  

There are several features we can add to aid our users depending on their goals. For example, in an ecommerce environment, a list of recently viewed or purchased items. </li>

</ul>
  
  <h3>Gerhardt-Powals' cognitive engineering principles  :</h3>These heuristics, or principles, are similar to Nielsen's heuristics but take a more holistic approach to evaluation for enhancing human-computer performance. 
<ul>
<li>
<h3>    Automate unwanted workload: :</h3>
    Eliminate mental calculations, estimations, comparisons, and any unnecessary thinking, to free cognitive resources for high-level tasks. .</li>
<li>
<h3>    Reduce uncertainty: </h3>
    Display data in a manner that is clear and obvious to reduce decision time and error. </li>
<li>
<h3>    Fuse data: :</h3>
    Bring together lower level data into a higher level summation to reduce cognitive load. </li>
<li>
<h3>    Present new information with meaningful aids to interpretation: :</h3>
    New information should be presented within familiar frameworks (e.g., schemas, metaphors, everyday terms) so that information is easier to absorb. </li>
<li>
<h3>    Use names that are conceptually related to function: :</h3>
Display names and labels should be context-dependent, which will improve recall and recognition.</li>
<li>
<h3>    Group data in consistently meaningful ways: </h3>
    Within a screen, data should be logically grouped; across screens, it should be consistently grouped. This will decrease information search time. </li>
<li>
<h3>    Limit data-driven tasks: :</h3>
    Use color and graphics, for example, to reduce the time spent assimilating raw data. </li>
<li>
<h3>    Include in the displays only that information needed by the user at a given time: :</h3>
    Exclude extraneous information that is not relevant to current tasks so that the user can focus attention on critical data. </li>
<li>
<h3>    Provide multiple coding of data when appropriate: </h3>
    The system should provide data in varying formats and/or levels of detail in order to promote cognitive flexibility and satisfy user preferences. </li>
<li>
<h3>    Practice judicious redundancy: </h3>
    Principle 10 was devised by the first two authors to resolve the possible conflict between Principles 6 and 8, that is, in order to be consistent, it is sometimes necessary to include more information than may be needed at a given time. </li>
</ul>

    <h3>Weinschenk and Barker classification:  </h3>Susan Weinschenk and Dean Barker created a categorization of heuristics and guidelines by several major providers into the following twenty types: 
<ul>
<li>
<h3>        User Control: </h3>
 The interface will allow the user to perceive that they are in control and will allow appropriate control. </li>
<li>
<h3>      Human Limitations: </h3>
    The interface will not overload the user’s cognitive, visual, auditory, tactile, or motor limits.  </li>
<li>
<h3>      Modal Integrity: </h3>
  The interface will fit individual tasks within whatever modality is being used: auditory, visual, or motor/kinesthetic.  </li>
<li>
<h3>        Accommodation: </h3>
    The interface will fit the way each user group works and thinks. </li>
<li>
<h3>        Linguistic Clarity: </h3>
The interface will communicate as efficiently as possible. </li>
<li>
<h3>        Aesthetic Integrity: </h3>
    The interface will have an attractive and appropriate design. </li>
<li>
<h3>       Simplicity: </h3>
   The interface will present elements simply.  </li>
<li>
<h3>     Predictability: </h3>
    The interface will behave in a manner such that users can accurately predict what will happen next. </li>
<li>
<h3>       Interpretation: </h3>
   The interface will make reasonable guesses about what the user is trying to do.  </li>
<li>
<h3>        Accuracy: </h3>
  The interface will be free from errors.  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>           Technical Clarity: </h3>
   The interface will have the highest possible fidelity. </li>
<li>
<h3>           Flexibility: : </h3>
   The interface will allow the user to adjust the design for custom use.  </li>
<li>
<h3>     Fulfillment: </h3>
   The interface will provide a satisfying user experience. </li>
<li>
<h3>           Cultural Propriety: : </h3>
  The interface will match the user’s social customs and expectations.  </li>
<li>
<h3>            Suitable Tempo: : </h3>
 The interface will operate at a tempo suitable to the user.   </li>
  <li>
<h3>           Consistency: : </h3>
 The interface will be consistent.  </li>
<li>
<h3>         User Support: : </h3>
 The interface will provide additional assistance as needed or requested.  </li>
<li>
<h3>        Precision: </h3>
 The interface will allow the users to perform a task exactly.   </li>
<li>
<h3>        Forgiveness: </h3>
  The interface will make actions recoverable.  </li>
  <li>
<h3>        Responsiveness: </h3>
  The interface will inform users about the results of their actions and the interface’s status.   </li>
</ul>
             <br>
  <p><h3> On studying all above methods for heuristic analysis, it is observed that Neilsen's principles are more generic when compared to Weinschenk and Barker classification. Hence, i personally believe that from a studying perspective understanding Neilsen's principles will give a general idea to the reader while Weinschenk and Barker classification helps from the perspective of usability testing wherein a checklist needs to be created.
  Bakers classification gives a detailed breakdown of the parameters.</h3> </p>
